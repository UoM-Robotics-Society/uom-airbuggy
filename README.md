## Objective
Two ways
- medium size with raspberry pi drone with ROS, camera streaming. Open construction, 3d printed frame by ourselves. 300 pounds in total for funding
- focus now on "finding missing persons" ( basically software focused drone )

- 80 pounds , motor  + ESC 
- 60 pounds , pi + camera 
- 30 pounds battery
- 40 pounds charger
- 50 pounds : extra ( transmitter, joystick etc. )
- 40 pounds : controller

## What it can do 
- Radio-controlled quadcopter 
- modulable, base for future projects
- camera 
- ROS 
- focus on swarm robotics (?) 

## Features
- large bandwidth
- base stations
- streaming

## Design
- Raspberry pi
  - for communication 
 
- Steering 
  - joystick like steering 
 
- Controller [to Look into] 
  - contact the UAV society ( or use one of the prebuilt https://emaxmodel.com/products/emax-skyline32-flight-controller-advanced-v1-1 ) 
  
- power [to look into]
  - Li-Pol battery 

## Ideas 
- docking stations ( both onground an on-air )
- Swarm robotics ( interaction between few robotics )
